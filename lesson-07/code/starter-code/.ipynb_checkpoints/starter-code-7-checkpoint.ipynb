Gradient Descent also introduces learning rate (how aggressively do we solve the problem), epsilon (at what point do we say the error margin is acceptable), and iterations (when should we stop no matter what?)\n",

    "- demonstrate the grid_search module!\n",

    "While exploring the Gradient Descent regressor object, you'll build a grid search using the stochastic gradient descent estimator for the bike-share data set. Continue with either the model you evaluated last class or the simpler one from today. In particular, be sure to implement the \"param_grid\" in the grid search to get answers for the following questions:\n",

    "- With a set of alpha values between 10^-10 and 10^-1, how does the mean squared error change?\n",
    "- Based on the data, we know when to properly use L1 vs L2 regularization. By using a grid search with L1_ratios between 0 and 1 (increasing every 0.05), does that statement hold true? If not, did gradient descent have enough iterations?\n",

    "Conclusion: From what is discussed in class, people usually use Ridge (L2) when there are more observations than features, just like our modeldata, which consists of 17378 observations and 5 features only. However, from the above experiments, I find that there are not that much difference between using Lasso or Ridge. MSE is minimized in roughly the same pace as n_iter increases (here I show n_iter = 5 and 50). L1_ratio does not affect the result for each alpha I use. However, for larger alphas (e.g. 1e-1), Lasso performs better than Ridge."

    "Conclusion: The stochastic gradient descent approach (SGD) seems to be outperform Ridge as we can minimize MSE in each iteration. MSE falls to a local minimum around 1673 after about 5-10 iterations. Previously, Ridge produces MSE of about 1814. Using the SGD also allows me to test different approach (L2, L1, Elastic Net). Gradient descent can take a lot of time and computationally expensive when the data is huge and we do not know exactly how large it is and thus set a large number of iternations to ensure a good result."
